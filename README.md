# unsupervised-semantic-analysis

Code developed for the research work: 

C. Echegoyen, A. Pérez, G. Santafé, U. Pérez-Goya and M.D Ugarte. Large-scale unsupervised spatio-temporal semantic analysis of vast regions from satellite images sequences. Statistics and Computing 34, 71 (2024).

We provide python notebooks with the experiments of the paper in the directory `experiments`.  

An example of the models and sequences of satelllite images used in the paper can be dowolad [here](https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/unsupervised-semantic-analysis.zip). The models should be in the directory `models` and the sequence of satellite images in the directory `data/NE-TXN`. The rest of models and images are not provided here due to space constraints, but they can be shared upon request.
