# unsupervised-semantic-analysis

Code developed for the research work: "Large-scale unsupervised spatio-temporal semantic analysis of vast regions from satellite images sequences"

We provide some python notebooks with the experiments conducted in the paper.  

We share the models trained for the experiments of the paper in the directory `models`

We provide an example of a sequence of stallite images in the directory `data`. The rest of images can be shared on request.
